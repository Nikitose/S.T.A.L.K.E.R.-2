As part of this project, the objective is to duplicate the articles, thus avoiding the repetition of their writing.The information from the items is recovered from a data file which contains the necessary information.The inclusion technique avoids repetition of the code by calling the header and the footer, thus avoiding the need to rewrite them with each occurrence.This simplifies the maintenance and management of the code by grouping together the common areas in separate files.',
